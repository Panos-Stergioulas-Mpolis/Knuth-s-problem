# Knuth-s-problem

This text is about a project that was assigned in the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Macedonia, under the Department of Applied Informatics. The project aimed to solve Knuth's problem, which states that starting from the number 4, it is possible to reach any other positive number using the factorial, floor, and square root operations. To solve the problem, the project utilized the BFS and DFS algorithms within a predetermined time limit.
