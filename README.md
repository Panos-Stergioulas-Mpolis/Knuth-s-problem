# Knuth-s-problem

Knuth's problem. This project was written as an assignment within the course Artificial Intelligence at 
the University of Macedonia in the Department of Applied Informatics.

Knuth's problem states that starting from the number 4 you can 
get to any other number using the factorial, floor, and square root operations.

To solve the problem, the BFS and DFS algorithms were used in a predetermined time interval.
